        <h1>About Me</h1>
    </div>
  <p>I was born on January 17th, 1998, in a small town named Enid in Oklahoma. My family moved to Cedar Park, TX when I was about three years old and I lived there for about twenty years until moving with my family to Brighton, Colorado in 2021.
    I started off my working career by working after school at a local Comic Book store called Titan Moon Comics in 2015. I worked there until 2021 and eventually became assistant manager before leaving to pursue something else. During Covid I had a hard time figuring out what I really wanted to do for a career before finally deciding to go into Video Editing as it was something I had already been teaching myself for years as a hobby and really enjoyed doing. I had also already edited a few projects for local businesses and family/friends.
    </p>
    <p>After going to FRCC for a few years for a degree in Video Production and Editing I graduated in December 2024 and am now looking to break into freelance video editing. This website is a portfolio to compile all of the projects I’ve worked on over the years both for classes and for personal work. If you’re looking for a video editor, hopefully you find something here that might fit the style of video you’d like to make! If you’d like to work with me, feel free to visit the “Contact Me” page to send me a message and we’ll get in touch!
        Hope to hear from you!</p>
